## Description:

    This is a simple implementation of the original Pong (Atari - 1972).
    Use the W and S keys to move the first racket, and the UP and DOWN arrows to move the socond racket!

## Dependencies:
    All that is required here is the ggez crate (using version 0.5.1),
    and the rand crate (using version 0.8.3)
